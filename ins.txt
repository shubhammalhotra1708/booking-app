# Salon Booking Platform UI Instructions for Copilot

## Vision
Create a modern salon booking platform UI, inspired by Booksy.com and tailored for the Indian market. The platform should be mobile-first, clean, and highly user-friendly, supporting both customers and salon owners. Focus on the MVP with core flows—searching, browsing, booking, and reviewing salons.

## Step-by-Step Feature Instructions

1. **Homepage Layout**
   - Top navigation bar with logo, search bar (location + service), sign in/up links.
   - Hero section with a search widget ("Find salons near you") and call-to-action.
   - Grid of featured salons with images, ratings, price ranges, and prominent 'Book Now' buttons.
   - Sidebar or top filters for services, price, ratings, and location.
   - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS, works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.

2. **Salon Listing**
   - Each salon card shows image, salon name, location, average rating, price range, and a button to view profile/book.
   - Use placeholder data for salons and staff for now.
   - Cards should be clickable and lead to a detailed salon profile page.

3. **Salon Profile Page**
   - Display salon info: images, address, description, opening hours.
   - List of services with prices.
   - Staff roster with photos, names, specialties, and "Book with this staff" option.
   - Reviews section: show user reviews/ratings.
   - 'Book Appointment' widget: select service, staff, date/time.

4. **Booking Flow**
   - Modal or dedicated page for appointment booking.
   - Step-by-step booking: select service, staff, date/time, enter customer details.
   - Confirmation screen with summary and mock confirmation message.

5. **Review Section**
   - Customers can leave reviews after booking (use dummy data for now).
   - Show average rating, latest reviews, and star breakdown.

6. **Salon Owner Dashboard (placeholder)**
   - A simple page for salon owners to see bookings, manage staff/services.
   - Indicate future integrations (not implemented yet).

7. **General UI/UX**
   - Clean, modern look—reference Booksy.com for card layouts, spacing, and typography.
   - Use Tailwind CSS for rapid styling and responsiveness.
   - Use Next.js pages for navigation (homepage, salon profile, booking, dashboard).
   - All data is static/dummy for now—API integrations will come later.

## Folder Structure Suggestions

- `components/` - reusable components (Navbar, SalonCard, BookingModal, ReviewSection, etc.)
- `pages/` - Next.js page files (`index.tsx`, `salon/[id].tsx`, `dashboard.tsx`, etc.)
- `styles/` - global styles or Tailwind config if needed.
- `public/` - images, icons, etc.

**Copilot, please generate the code for each component and page step by step as described above. Use placeholder data and focus on delivering a full UI MVP.**
